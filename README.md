# Automated-macchanging-on-linux
This is only for linux
Reason - Because linux has a terminal macchanger

This python code needs to be set into the system as the code needs root permission as if you want this on start up, then it needs to be set into the system files to then escalate privilidges

You can steal this, you can modify this i really dont care. you can sell this if youd like. 
You can send ping requests to google.com or 127.0.0.1/localhost if you wish, but this code automatically send pings, if there is a positive ping-send-back it will no matter what, change you MAC address.
By doing so this maybe might affect you internet assuming you dont have any mac-priviledges set up.
Then after the pings have been secured, every time something for example restrictions of wifi that have a vulnerability that allows a device to change MAC and still connect for a period of time, this does this but every time you get a 'filtered' packet from google/localhost it automatically changes MAC and then resumes pinging for google/localhost

This is to the people who have restrictions on their wifi, this might solve the problem. 
If this doesnt then, cry about it.

reasons why it might not work:
1. no clue
2. fix it yourself?
